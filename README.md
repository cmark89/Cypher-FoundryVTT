# Cypher-FoundryVTT

## What is this?

This project is a generified version of SolarBear's [Numenera system](https://github.com/SolarBear/Numenera-FoundryVTT) for the [Foundry virtual tabletop](http://foundryvtt.com/#about-foundry-virtual-tabletop). This system aims to provide a solid and extendable baseline from which other Cypher system games can be developed and played. 

## Features
At the moment, there's not much new here, but that will hopefully change soon! Upcoming features include support for [Cypher shorts](https://www.montecookgames.com/cypher-shorts/), optional Cypher modules such as horror mode, and other tools to make running any Cypher game more immersive and enjoyable for everyone involved.
